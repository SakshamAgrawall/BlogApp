## AWS EC2
- I also deploy my project in AWS EC2 for understanding the AWS EC2 where i first make an instance of window because aws provides us to a remote computer access so it is also easy for me so i aws i first get access of remote computer where i install node js and then copy my file to the aws ec2 instance then i start my project local bute there i only deploy my react project instead of deploying my full stack becuase i forget to make env file of react_APP_APi so i had to change change all i just deploy only react api and in securtiy section i give the port addrress for accessing aws url out and this way i use aws i can do so many thinks with aws but at the sort of time i just use my react application to deploy and for data base i use mongo db cluster which provide the db cloud of mongidb users.
